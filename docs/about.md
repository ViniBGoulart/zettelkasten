Hi, my name is Vinicius Goulart a.k.a [blazu](https://twitter.com/vinibgoulart). I'm Software Engineer and seek to update myself with market technologies, and I am always having fun with some tech.

I worked for 3~ months with `PHP`, `Laravel` and the related ecosystem. But currently I have been working for 6~ months with `Typescript`, `React`, `NextJS` and others Javascript frameworks. I also have experience developing `REST APIs` in the `NodeJS` and `Laravel` ecosystem, with databases like `MongoDB` and `MySQL`.

I currently learning `GraphQL` data query language using `Relay` framework.
