Do what you don't know, it's the best form to learn something. If you only do what you know, you will not be evolving. I don't know english, but I try to write in english.

- Accept tasks that you don't know how to do
- Write about you don't know
- Ask what you don't know

You will increase your value if you show others and prove to yourself that you be able to accept challenges that make you leave the comfort zone.

If you just do what you know you will be normal.

Go after and always seek knowledge, regardless of the difficulty of the task. The most difficult ones for you are the ones that will most add knowledge.

In the end you will see that it's worth it. Will be in front of those who refused the challenge and kept doing the things they are used to.
