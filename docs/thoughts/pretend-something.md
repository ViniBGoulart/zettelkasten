Pretend something until it really is.

If you want to be something or do something you're not yet, just pretend it.

If you act as something your thoughts will follow your desire and work subconsciously to achieve this.

Acting like something is the best way to become something. If you don't, it will take longer to reach, and when that happens you will not be prepared.

If you should be a Senior, act as a Senior. If you don't, it you will not be living the experience.

It doesn't just apply to job titles, apply it to your feelings, your daily acts that you want to achieve.
