If you want be a leader, you must act as a leader.

Leadership is:

- Know to speak in public
- Know answer what the team needs to hear
- Be active
- Be friendly and understanding
- Prove to be on top of the subject
- Prove to be interested in subject
- Prove that you want that the project grow up
- Prove that you'll search more and more knowledge
- Prove that you like challenges
- Prove that you care
- Prove that you have attitude
- Prove that you are not timid
- Prove that you want to grow up
- Prove that you enjoy hear other points of view

Act as a leader will increase your value. People's view of you will improve.

You need to make it act asynchronously on you.

But don't go around thinking you're better than other people, that's ugly.

Acting as a leader got me promoted where I worked, but be careful not to be disrespectful to people and say that only your way is right, know how to listen.

Act like something you're not until you really are.
